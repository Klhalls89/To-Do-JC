## `clone these two repos`

  [Front-End](https://github.com/Klhalls89/otter-do)
  [Back-End](https://github.com/Klhalls89/otter-do-BE)
  
* note that my Back-End is almost identical to [this](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jumpcloud-ui-assignment), except that I had to install CORS to enable my fetch call and I altered the start script to run the server in nodemon for quick reloading.

### `npm install`
  run npm install in both repos

### `npm start`
   run npm start in both repos, Back-End first please.
  
  Back-End opens in [http://localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004)
  Front-End opens in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
  
## Thoughts on this process

I liked this challenge overall. I have built an idea box like this in the past but this was the first time I have done it with an API back end. I did take some artistic liberties with the UI aspect of the project because I think it represents the kind of designer/developer/engineer I am. I made the otter logo myself, the layout is a combination of Grid/Flexbox in SCSS with media queries for different screen sizes. I used React because, while I have done a project in Vue before, I was most comfortable with React. I know that React is moving away from class based components and toward hooks however, I haven't used them before and I was hesitant to use this project as my guinea pig. I also had an issue getting the linter set up properly in this project so I linted by hand. On the whole I think it was a successful project with a friendly UI.
