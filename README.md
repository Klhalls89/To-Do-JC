## `clone these two repos`

  Front-End https://github.com/Klhalls89/otter-do
  Back-End https://github.com/Klhalls89/To-Do-JC-BE
  
* note that my Back-End is almost identical to https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jumpcloud-ui-assignment except that I had to install CORS to enable my fetch call and I altered the start script to run the server in nodemon for quick reloading.

### `npm install`
  run npm install in both repos

### `npm start`
   run npm start in both repos, Back-End first please.
  
  Back-End opens in [http://localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004)
  Front-End opens in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
